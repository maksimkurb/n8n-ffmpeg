# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Updated GitHub Actions to Node 24-ready majors: `actions/checkout` v4→v6, `docker/setup-buildx-action` v3→v4, `docker/login-action` v3→v4, `docker/build-push-action` v5→v7 (GitHub forces Node 24 for actions from 2026-06-16).

### Fixed
- Default Dockerfile variants (main and runners) no longer reinstall `apk-tools` from the Alpine CDN, which broke builds after Alpine published `apk-tools` 2.14.10 against the hardened base's hash-pinned packages. The donor's static `apk` is now kept as `/sbin/apk` and used to install FFmpeg directly, so builds are immune to upstream point releases while `apk` stays available at runtime. See [Dockerfile variants](docs/dockerfile-variants.md#with-apk-tools).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-06

### Added
- Task runners image (`ghcr.io/maksimkurb/n8n-runners-ffmpeg`) extending `ghcr.io/n8n-io/runners` with FFmpeg, in the same two variants as the main image (`Dockerfile.runners` and `Dockerfile.runners.no-apk-tools`). ([#4](https://github.com/RxChi1d/n8n-ffmpeg/issues/4))
- Runners Dockerfiles patch `/etc/n8n-task-runners.json` so the Code Node module allowlists (`NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_BUILTIN`, `NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_EXTERNAL`, `N8N_RUNNERS_STDLIB_ALLOW`, `N8N_RUNNERS_EXTERNAL_ALLOW`) become configurable via container environment variables, with defaults identical to the official image.
- Default Dockerfile variants (main and runners) detect the base image's Alpine version from `/etc/os-release` at build time instead of hardcoding it, so package repositories always match the runtime base. `/etc/os-release` is used because the n8n base (Docker Hardened Images) ships no `/etc/alpine-release`.
- Detection failures now abort the build: an empty detected version is guarded against, and the keys `cp -n` fallback no longer masks earlier errors in the install chain.
- README (English and zh-tw) section for the task runners image with an `external` mode Docker Compose example.

### Changed
- `build-and-push.yml` accepts a `variant` input (`main` / `runners`) that resolves the Dockerfile and target image, with per-variant build cache scopes.
- `check-updates.yml` checks each variant independently and triggers builds separately, so one variant lagging upstream never blocks the other.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-12-25

### Added
- Default Dockerfile variant restores apk-tools before installing FFmpeg.
- Clean Dockerfile variant (`Dockerfile.no-apk-tools`) that keeps the final image free of apk/apk-tools.
- Combined Dockerfile variants documentation with anchored sections for deep linking.
- English documentation for Dockerfile variants.

### Changed
- README (English and zh-tw) now documents the n8n@2.1.0 change that moved apk-tools removal to the final stage.
- README (English and zh-tw) now links to the Dockerfile variants document sections.
