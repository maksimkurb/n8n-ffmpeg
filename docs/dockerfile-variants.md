# Dockerfile variants

n8n-base removes apk-tools, so the official n8n image cannot use `apk add` directly. This project provides two Dockerfile variants.

## Why the original `apk add` approach fails

We originally installed ffmpeg by running `apk add ffmpeg` in the Dockerfile. Starting from n8n-base, the `apk del apk-tools` step was moved into the final stage, so the official n8n image no longer includes `apk`. As a result, the original approach fails at build time and must be replaced by either restoring apk-tools or using a clean install.

Reference: n8n-base Dockerfile (release: [n8n@2.1.0](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases/tag/n8n%402.1.0), change: [PR #23149](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/23149), [Line 45](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/f4a43a273a776f4bf5a82c521a6490526182e694/docker/images/n8n-base/Dockerfile#L45))

## With apk-tools (default)

### Goal

Keep the official n8n base image, give it a working `apk` so ffmpeg can be installed, and leave that `apk` available at runtime for users who need to install other packages.

### Design notes

- n8n-base removes apk-tools, so `apk add` fails.
- Use a multi-stage build to copy `apk.static` and keys from Alpine, install ffmpeg with `apk.static`, then keep that static binary as `/sbin/apk` in the final image.
- Avoid downloading `apk.static` directly to skip HTML parsing and avoid depending on tools like `grep` and `wget`.
- Merge keys with `cp -n` to avoid overwriting existing files.
- The Alpine version for the package repositories is detected from the base image's `/etc/os-release` at build time, so it always matches the runtime base even when upstream bumps its Alpine release. `/etc/os-release` is used because the n8n base (Docker Hardened Images) ships no `/etc/alpine-release`.
- **Do not reinstall the `apk-tools` package from the CDN.** The n8n base is a Docker Hardened Image whose `/etc/apk/world` pins every package to an exact content hash, and Alpine's `main` repo only keeps the latest point release. Reinstalling `apk-tools` always pulls the newest version, so once Alpine bumps it (e.g. `2.14.9` → `2.14.10`) the freshly pulled `libapk2` no longer matches the pinned hash and the build fails with `breaks: world[libapk2><...>]`. Keeping the donor's static `apk` instead never touches the pinned packages, so the build is immune to upstream point releases.

### Usage

- Main Dockerfile: [`Dockerfile`](../Dockerfile)

```bash
docker build -t n8n-ffmpeg:local --build-arg N8N_VERSION=2.1.4 .
```

### When to use

- You need `apk` at runtime to install packages beyond ffmpeg.
- The most general choice if you do not require the smallest possible image.

<a id="no-apk-tools"></a>
## No apk-tools (clean install)

### Goal

Do not introduce apk or apk-tools into the final image. Only add the files required by ffmpeg and keep the result close to the official n8n image.

### Design notes

- Install ffmpeg in a builder stage on Alpine; do not bring apk or apk-tools into the final image.
- Copy only ffmpeg/ffprobe and required shared libraries into `/opt/ffmpeg` to avoid overwriting system files.
- Use wrappers to set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` only when running ffmpeg.
- Minimize differences from the official n8n image.

### Usage

- Clean Dockerfile: [`Dockerfile.no-apk-tools`](../Dockerfile.no-apk-tools)

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile.no-apk-tools -t n8n-ffmpeg:clean --build-arg N8N_VERSION=2.1.4 .
```

### When to use

- You only need ffmpeg and do not need to install other packages at runtime.
- You want the runtime environment to stay as close as possible to the official image.

## Task runners image variants

The same two approaches apply to the official `ghcr.io/n8n-io/runners` image (the sidecar for task runners in `external` mode), which also removes apk-tools in its final stage:

- **Default (with apk-tools)**: [`Dockerfile.runners`](../Dockerfile.runners), published as `ghcr.io/maksimkurb/n8n-runners-ffmpeg`.
- **Clean (no apk-tools)**: [`Dockerfile.runners.no-apk-tools`](../Dockerfile.runners.no-apk-tools), self-build only.

### Differences from the main-image variants

- **Alpine version detection (default variant)**: same `/etc/os-release` detection as the main `Dockerfile`. It matters even more here because the runners runtime base (`python:3.13-alpine`) does not pin its Alpine release, so a hardcoded `ALPINE_VERSION` would silently break when the base image moves to a newer Alpine.
- **Code Node allowlist passthrough (both variants)**: the stock runners image hardcodes `NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_BUILTIN`, `NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_EXTERNAL`, `N8N_RUNNERS_STDLIB_ALLOW` and `N8N_RUNNERS_EXTERNAL_ALLOW` in the `env-overrides` section of `/etc/n8n-task-runners.json`, which makes the launcher silently discard values set on the container. Both variants patch the config at build time to move these keys to the launcher's `allowed-env` passthrough list, and set image-level `ENV` defaults identical to the stock values. Behavior is unchanged unless you explicitly override them (e.g. `NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_BUILTIN=crypto,child_process` to let the JavaScript Code Node spawn ffmpeg).

### Usage

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile.runners -t n8n-runners-ffmpeg:local --build-arg N8N_VERSION=2.25.5 .
docker build -f Dockerfile.runners.no-apk-tools -t n8n-runners-ffmpeg:clean --build-arg N8N_VERSION=2.25.5 .
```
